  "body": "# php-stanford-corenlp-adapter\r\nPHP adapter for Stanford CoreNLP tools<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<b>What does it do</b><br />\r\nIt takes a Part-Of-Speech(POS) parse from CoreNLP and creates a POS Tree with depths, ID's and parentID's. It is designed to be used with Stanford CoreNLP, where CoreNLP is working as a server. However, it could easily be modified to take a parse from the Stanford online parser here: http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/index.jsp, since the POS parse is of the same format\r\n\r\n<b>What does it not do</b><br />\r\nIt does not do lemma's and dependency parsing (yet)<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<b>Installation/ requirements</b><br />\r\n1) Stanford CoreNLP 3.6.0<br />\r\n- Download / install CoreNLP 3.6.0: http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html#download<br />\r\n- How to use CoreNLP server: http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html <br />\r\n- Go to installation directory and start: \"java -mx4g -cp \"*\" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000\" <br />\r\n- If port 9000 is used by another program, use port 9001 <br />\r\n\r\n2) PHP cURL: If you haven't got cURL installed: download here: https://curl.haxx.se/download.html<br />\r\n3) Change the configuration settings in \"index.php\" for your situation. <br />\r\n\r\n<b>Usage</b><br />\r\nSee index.php for example usage\r\n\r\n<b>Notes</b><br />\r\n- Tested on Windows and Linux<br />\r\n- Tested on PHP 5.3 and PHP 7<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
